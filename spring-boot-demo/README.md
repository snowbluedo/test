# Spring boot demo 

This is a demo project that integrates the following dependencies: WEB、JPA、DevTools、Thymeleaf、MySQL.

It'll require to set up a local mysql database `localhost:3306/test`, or you can modify the configuration in 
`application.properties`.

You can add the `settings.xml` to your `~/.m2/` directory to use ali repo instead of mvn offical repo which will
be much faster.
